DEX-Arbitrage

Ethereum-based arbitrage bot that takes advantage of price differences between Uniswap and Sushiswap decentralized exchanges. The contract is written in Solidity and uses the UniswapV2 and SushiSwap Router interfaces.
Setup

    Access Remix IDE and MetaMask.
    Right Click the 'Contracts' folder and then create 'New File'. Rename it whatever you want, or: “bot.sol”
    Paste the bot.sol source code from the repository into the file you just created.
    Go to the "Compile" tab on Remix and Compile with Solidity version 0.6.6
    Go to the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab on Remix, select the "Injected Provider" environment, then "Deploy". This will create your own contract by confirming the MetaMask Contract creation fee
    Deposit funds (at least 0.2 ETH to prevent negating slippage) to your exact contract/bot address
    After your transaction is confirmed, start the bot by clicking the "Start" button. Withdraw anytime by clicking "Withdrawal". Wait about a day for best profit potential.
