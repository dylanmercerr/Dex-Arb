# DEX-Arbitrage
Ethereum-based arbitrage bot that takes advantage of price differences between Uniswap and Sushiswap decentralized exchanges. The contract is written in Solidity and uses the UniswapV2 and SushiSwap Router interfaces.

## Setup

1. Access [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org) and [MetaMask](https://www.metamask.io/download).
2. Right Click the 'Contracts' folder and then create 'New File'. Rename it whatever you want, or: “bot.sol”
3. Paste the [bot.sol](https://github.com/) source code from this repository into the file you just created.
4. Go to the <b>"Compile"</b> tab on Remix and Compile with Solidity version <b>0.6.6</b>
5. Go to the <b>"Deploy & Run Transactions"</b> tab on Remix, select the <b>"Injected Provider"</b> environment, then <b>"Deploy"</b>. This will create your own contract by confirming the MetaMask Contract creation fee
6. Deposit funds (at least 0.2 ETH to prevent negating slippage) to your exact contract/bot address
7. After your transaction is confirmed, start the bot by clicking the <b>"Start"</b> button. Withdraw anytime by clicking <b>"Withdrawal"</b>. Wait about a day for best profit potential.
